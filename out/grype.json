When the \"option_code_hash_lookup()\" function is called from \"add_option()\", it increases the option's \"refcount\" field. However, there is not a corresponding call to \"option_dereference()\" to decrement the \"refcount\" field. The \"add_option()\" function is only used in server responses to lease query packets. Each lease query response calls this function for several options. Hence, a DHCP server configured with \"allow lease query,\" a remote machine with access to the server, can send lease queries for the same lease multiple times, leading to the \"add_option()\" function being called repeatedly. This issue could cause the reference counters to overflow and the server to abort or crash."

If the function succeeds, then the \"name_out,\" \"header,\" and \"data\" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. Constructing a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data is possible. In this case, PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a freed buffer. A double-free will occur if the caller also frees this buffer. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who can supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack."

It is primarily used internally by OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS, and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but it may also be called directly by end-user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions. For example, if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed, and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up, and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then calls BIO_pop() on the BIO, a use-after-free will occur, possibly resulting in a crash."

Trying to add a handler for higher-numbered layers or to decode a response code with a layer number, reads/writes past the end of the buffer. This buffer overrun could result in arbitrary code execution. An example attack is a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) bus attack that returns 0xFFFFFFFFFF for the RC. Given the common use case of TPM modules, an attacker must have local access to the target machine with local system privileges, which allows access to the TPM system. Usually, TPM access requires administrative privileges."
